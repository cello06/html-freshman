		<h1>Text Styling</h1>
		<p>In a solid solution, the terms "solute" and "solvent" are used to describe components based on their relative proportions or the dominant presence within the mixture.</p>

		<h2>A Blocquote</h2>
		<blockquote>The solute is the component present in a smaller quantity or the one that gets dissolved into the larger quantity, known as the solvent. For instance, in an alloy like brass (copper-zinc mixture), if copper is present in a higher proportion than zinc, copper would be considered the solvent and zinc the solute. This determination is based on the quantity and dominant presence of each component in the mixture.</blockquote>
